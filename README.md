```

### Content Structure
1. **Summary**: AI-generated meeting summary
2. **Highlights**: Key points and decisions
3. **Transcript**: Full meeting transcript (if available)
4. **Attendees**: List of participants
5. **Attachments**: Links to related documents

## Conflict Resolution

The plugin detects and handles various conflict scenarios:

### Conflict Types
1. **User Modified**: You've edited the local note
2. **Both Modified**: Changes in both Granola and local
3. **File Missing**: Note deleted locally but updated in Granola
4. **Duplicate ID**: Multiple files for the same meeting
5. **Path Conflict**: File would overwrite existing non-meeting note

### Resolution Options
- **Keep Local**: Preserve your changes
- **Keep Remote**: Use Granola's version
- **Merge**: Attempt to combine changes
- **Backup & Update**: Save local version before updating
- **Skip**: Leave unchanged

## Performance Optimization

### Large Meeting Libraries
- Automatic batch size adjustment based on performance
- Memory usage monitoring and throttling
- Streaming API support for datasets > 1000 meetings
- Progress saving for resumable syncs

### Best Practices
1. Run initial sync during off-hours for large libraries
2. Enable auto-sync for incremental updates
3. Use date-based organization for better performance
4. Keep debug mode off unless troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Failed to connect to Granola"
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure Granola services are operational

#### "Path exists but is not a file"
- Check for folders with the same name as expected files
- Verify folder organization settings
- Use the conflict resolution dialog

#### Sync seems slow
- Check Settings > Debug Mode is OFF
- Reduce sync interval if auto-sync is enabled
- Consider date-based organization for large vaults

### Debug Information
Enable debug mode in settings to see detailed logs:
1. Settings > Granola Sync > Debug Mode
2. Open Developer Console (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I)
3. Look for entries starting with `[Granola Sync]`

### File Explorer Display Issues
If your file explorer shows folders/files in a grid layout instead of a list:
- This is caused by themes or other plugins modifying the file explorer CSS
- Use the CSS snippet in `troubleshooting/file-explorer-fixes/file-explorer-layout-fix-granola.css` to fix this issue

## Security & Privacy

- API keys are stored locally in your vault
- All communication uses HTTPS
- No data is sent to third parties
- Meeting content remains private
- Open source for transparency
