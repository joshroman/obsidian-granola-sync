# Granola Sync - Obsidian Plugin (Proof of Concept)

## Week 0: Proof of Concept Complete âœ…

This minimal Obsidian plugin has been created to validate our development setup before building the full Granola meeting sync functionality.

## What Was Created

1. **Basic Plugin Structure**
   - `manifest.json` - Plugin metadata
   - `main.ts` - TypeScript source code
   - `main.js` - Compiled JavaScript plugin
   - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
   - `package.json` - Node.js project configuration with build scripts

2. **Plugin Features**
   - Loads successfully in Obsidian
   - Adds a command "Test Granola Connection" to the Command Palette
   - Shows a notice when the command is executed
   - Adds a ribbon icon that shows a different notice when clicked
   - Console logging for debugging

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open the test vault in Obsidian**:
   ```
   ~/ObsidianTestVault
   ```

2. **Enable the plugin**:
   - Open Settings (gear icon)
   - Go to Community plugins
   - Turn off "Restricted mode" if needed
   - Find "Granola Sync" in the installed plugins list
   - Toggle it on

3. **Test the plugin**:
   - Open Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + P)
   - Search for "Test Granola Connection"
   - Execute the command - you should see a notice: "Granola Sync: Plugin is working! ðŸŽ‰"
   - Click the sync icon in the left ribbon - you should see: "Granola Sync: Ready to sync meetings!"
   - Open Developer Tools (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + I) and check the console for log messages

## Development Workflow

1. **Make changes to `main.ts`**
2. **Build the plugin**: `npm run build`
3. **Copy to test vault**: `cp main.js manifest.json ~/ObsidianTestVault/.obsidian/plugins/granola-sync/`
4. **Reload Obsidian**: Cmd/Ctrl + R or use the "Reload app without saving" command
5. **Test your changes**

For continuous development:
- Run `npm run dev` to watch for changes and auto-rebuild
- Still need to manually copy files and reload Obsidian

## Next Steps

With this proof of concept validated, we can proceed with the full implementation plan:
- Week 1-2: Foundation & Testing Framework
- Week 3-4: Core Sync Engine
- Week 5: Performance & Error Handling
- Week 6: UI/UX Polish
- Week 7: Testing & Edge Cases
- Week 8: Documentation & Release

## Project Status

âœ… **Week 0 Complete**: Minimal plugin successfully created and ready for testing in Obsidian.
