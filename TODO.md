# TODO.md - Obsidian Granola Sync Plugin

## Current Focus: Consolidation Sprint

Based on expert consensus from o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3-mini, we are executing a focused consolidation sprint before adding any new features.

### Consolidation Sprint Tasks (3-4 weeks)

#### Week 1: Analysis & Planning
- [ ] Create component inventory matrix
  - [ ] List all sync engine implementations
  - [ ] List all state manager implementations  
  - [ ] Identify overlapping functionality
  - [ ] Document unique features in each
- [ ] Select canonical implementations
  - [ ] Choose primary sync engine (likely hardened-sync-engine.ts)
  - [ ] Choose primary state manager
  - [ ] Document rationale for choices
- [ ] Fix failing tests
  - [ ] Address timezone issues
  - [ ] Fix async race conditions
  - [ ] Resolve mock initialization problems
  - [ ] Achieve 100% test pass rate

#### Week 2: Consolidation
- [ ] Merge missing features into canonical engine
  - [ ] Review each deprecated engine for unique logic
  - [ ] Port essential features to canonical version
  - [ ] Ensure no functionality is lost
- [ ] Delete redundant implementations
  - [ ] Remove deprecated sync engines
  - [ ] Remove deprecated state managers
  - [ ] Update all imports to use canonical versions
- [ ] Update documentation
  - [ ] Mark canonical files clearly
  - [ ] Add deprecation notices
  - [ ] Update architecture diagrams

#### Week 3: Validation & Quality
- [ ] Test all Phase 2 requirements thoroughly
  - [ ] API integration with authentication
  - [ ] All three path generation modes (flat, by-date, mirror-granola)
  - [ ] Conflict resolution scenarios
  - [ ] Idempotent sync operations
- [ ] Performance validation
  - [ ] Test with 1000+ meetings
  - [ ] Memory usage profiling
  - [ ] Sync time benchmarks
- [ ] Security audit
  - [ ] API key storage verification
  - [ ] Input validation testing
  - [ ] Error message sanitization

#### Week 4: Quality Gates & Documentation
- [ ] Establish CI/CD quality gates
  - [ ] 100% test pass requirement
  - [ ] Code coverage thresholds
  - [ ] Linting enforcement
  - [ ] Type checking strictness
- [ ] Update all documentation
  - [ ] Synchronize phase numbering
  - [ ] Document canonical architecture
  - [ ] Create migration guide
- [ ] Prepare for beta testing
  - [ ] Create test plan
  - [ ] Set up feedback channels
  - [ ] Document known limitations

## Completed Phases (v1.0)

### Core Development
✅ **Phase 0**: Proof of Concept
✅ **Phase 0.5**: Critical Infrastructure & Junior Dev Setup
✅ **Phase 1**: Foundation & Testing Framework
✅ **Phase 2**: Core Sync Engine
✅ **Phase 3**: Performance & Error Handling
✅ **Phase 4**: UI/UX Polish
✅ **Phase 5**: Testing & Edge Cases
✅ **Phase 6**: Test Rehabilitation

### Extended Development
✅ **Phase 7**: Test Infrastructure & CI/CD
✅ **Phase 8**: Conflict Resolution
✅ **Phase 9**: Logging & Performance
✅ **Phase 10**: Sync Engine Hardening
✅ **Phase 11**: Enhanced UI/UX
✅ **Phase 12**: Documentation & Release

### Version 2.0 Features
✅ **Phase 13** (formerly duplicate Phase 1): Panel/Template Support

## Post-Consolidation Roadmap

### Version 1.0 Release
1. Beta testing with community
2. Bug fixes from beta feedback
3. Performance optimization
4. Official submission to Obsidian Community Plugins

### Version 2.0 Planning
1. Two-way sync capabilities
2. Selective sync filters
3. Custom template system
4. Bulk operations
5. Enhanced search integration

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Multiple Sync Engines**: 4 different implementations need consolidation
2. **Failing Tests**: Some tests still failing, blocking CI/CD
3. **Documentation Sync**: Phase numbering confusion needs resolution
4. **Code Organization**: Redundant implementations scattered across files

## Development Guidelines

1. **NO NEW FEATURES** until consolidation is complete
2. All changes must maintain 100% test pass rate
3. Document which files are canonical
4. Use atomic commits with clear messages
5. Get expert review before major decisions

## Success Criteria for Consolidation

- ✅ Single sync engine implementation (all others deleted)
- ✅ Single state manager implementation (all others deleted)
- ✅ 100% test pass rate with no skipped tests
- ✅ All Phase 2 requirements verified working
- ✅ Clear documentation of canonical implementations
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with enforced quality gates
- ✅ Performance benchmarks established
- ✅ Security audit completed

## Notes

- Current test status: Multiple failures need addressing
- Primary goal: Stability over features
- Timeline: 3-4 weeks of focused effort
- Approach: Consolidate, don't rewrite from scratch
