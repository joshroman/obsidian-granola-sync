# Product Requirements Document - Obsidian Granola Sync

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Knowledge workers who use Granola for AI-powered meeting transcription and Obsidian for personal knowledge management face a significant workflow gap. Their valuable meeting insights remain siloed in Granola, disconnected from their broader knowledge graph in Obsidian. This separation forces manual copy-paste workflows, reduces the discoverability of meeting insights, and prevents users from building comprehensive, interconnected knowledge bases.

### Solution Overview
Obsidian Granola Sync is an open-source plugin that automatically synchronizes meeting notes from Granola to Obsidian vaults. It provides configurable organization options, preserves meeting metadata, and ensures data integrity while respecting user privacy and local-first principles.

### Target Market
Individual knowledge workers, consultants, researchers, and productivity enthusiasts who:
- Use both Granola and Obsidian in their daily workflow
- Value unified knowledge management
- Prioritize data privacy and local storage
- Seek automation to reduce manual work

### Success Metrics
- **Reliability**: 99%+ successful sync operations
- **Performance**: Sync 1000+ meetings efficiently
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive community feedback and high plugin ratings
- **Feature Completeness**: Core sync, organization, and conflict resolution capabilities

## Product Vision

3. **Local Storage**: All data must remain on user's device
4. **Platform Testing**: Currently only tested on macOS
5. **Obsidian API Limits**: Must respect vault operation limits

### Assumptions
1. Users have active Granola and Obsidian installations
2. Users are comfortable installing community plugins
3. Granola continues to store data locally
4. Meeting volume typically under 5000 per user
5. Users want one-way sync (Granola â†’ Obsidian)

### Dependencies
- Obsidian Plugin API stability
- Granola local data structure
- Filesystem permissions
- Network connectivity for API calls

## Roadmap & Future Considerations

### Near Term (v1.x)
- Windows and Linux testing/support
- Folder structure mirroring (when API available)
- Bulk operations UI
- Enhanced template customization

### Medium Term (v2.x)
- Official Granola API migration
- Two-way sync exploration
- Advanced filtering options
- Meeting search and preview

### Long Term
- Integration with other meeting tools
- AI-powered meeting insights
- Collaborative features
- Mobile companion app

### API Migration Strategy
When official Granola API becomes available:
1. Implement parallel API support
2. Automatic migration for existing users
3. Deprecation timeline for unofficial API
4. Feature parity verification

## Out of Scope

### Current Version
1. **Mobile Synchronization**: No mobile Obsidian plugin support
2. **Real-time Collaboration**: Not a collaborative tool
3. **Two-way Sync**: Changes in Obsidian don't sync back
4. **Meeting Creation**: Cannot create meetings from Obsidian
5. **Granola Feature Integration**: No direct Granola UI access

### Permanent Exclusions
1. **Cloud Storage**: Will not store user data on external servers
2. **Account Management**: No user accounts or authentication
3. **Paid Features**: Core functionality remains free
4. **Analytics/Tracking**: No user behavior tracking
5. **Proprietary Formats**: Markdown only, no binary formats

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Changes**: Monitor for breaks, quick patches, community communication
- **Data Loss**: Comprehensive backups, never delete source data
- **Performance Issues**: Profiling, optimization, batch size limits

### User Risks
- **Privacy Concerns**: Clear documentation, local-only guarantee
- **Learning Curve**: Setup wizard, video tutorials, templates
- **Conflicts**: Smart detection, clear UI, safe defaults
