## Critical Failed Test Details

### Integration Verification Test
**File**: test/integration/integration-verify.spec.ts:282
**Error**: `WebDriverError: javascript error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'removeClass')`
**Analysis**: CSS-related JavaScript error when opening plugin settings
**Impact**: Visual evidence capture fails, indicating CSS integration issues

### CSS Scoping Test
**File**: test/e2e/css-scoping.spec.ts
**Error**: CSS selectors affecting file explorer functionality
**Analysis**: CSS cleanup may have introduced scoping issues affecting Obsidian's file explorer
**Impact**: Plugin CSS is interfering with core Obsidian functionality

### Append Mode Bug Test
**Error**: Expected 2 files, received 3 files
**Analysis**: File creation logic may be creating duplicate files
**Impact**: Data integrity issues with meeting synchronization

### Clean Sync Test
**Error**: Expected 5 files, received 6 files  
**Analysis**: State management issues causing extra file creation
**Impact**: Inconsistent sync behavior

## Acceptance Criteria Validation
Based on CSS cleanup requirements:
- [ ] **CSS Isolation**: FAILED - Tests show CSS affecting file explorer
- [ ] **No JavaScript Errors**: FAILED - removeClass errors in settings
- [ ] **Visual Consistency**: FAILED - Cannot capture visual evidence
- [ ] **Functional Preservation**: FAILED - File explorer conflicts detected

## Feature Status: ‚ùå NOT READY

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **CSS Scoping Failure**: Plugin CSS is affecting Obsidian's file explorer
2. **JavaScript Runtime Errors**: undefined removeClass calls in settings UI
3. **File Creation Logic**: Inconsistent file counts in sync operations
4. **Visual Integration**: Cannot capture visual evidence due to script errors

### Required Actions:
1. **Fix CSS Scoping Issues**:
   - Review CSS selectors in cleanup
   - Ensure proper scoping to prevent file explorer conflicts
   - Test CSS isolation thoroughly

2. **Resolve JavaScript Errors**:
   - Fix undefined removeClass references
   - Ensure all CSS class operations are properly scoped
   - Test settings UI functionality

3. **Debug File Creation Logic**:
   - Investigate append mode file counting
   - Review state management for duplicate prevention
   - Ensure clean sync operations

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Fix test environment setup (ensureTestEnvironment function)
   - Ensure visual evidence capture works
   - Validate CSS integration in real Obsidian environment

### Commands to Fix:
```bash
# Debug specific failing tests
npm run test:e2e -- -g "CSS scoping" --debug
npm run test:integration-verify

# Check CSS scoping manually
npm run build && # Test in actual Obsidian

# Review CSS changes
git diff HEAD~1 -- "*.css" "*.scss"
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The CSS cleanup feature has introduced **regression issues** that affect core Obsidian functionality:

1. **CSS Selector Conflicts**: Cleanup may have removed necessary scoping
2. **JavaScript Integration**: CSS class operations are failing
3. **State Management**: File creation logic has inconsistencies
4. **Test Environment**: Integration tests have setup issues

## Recommendation

**Feature is NOT READY for release.** The CSS cleanup has introduced critical regressions that affect:
- Core Obsidian file explorer functionality
- Plugin settings UI stability  
- Meeting synchronization reliability
- Visual integration testing capability

### Next Steps:
1. Revert problematic CSS changes
2. Implement CSS scoping with proper isolation
3. Fix JavaScript errors in settings UI
4. Ensure all E2E tests pass before considering complete
5. Add visual regression tests for CSS changes

**Estimated Fix Time**: 1-2 days to resolve scoping and integration issues.
