# API Integration Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Fixed HTTP Request Handling

1. **Body Handling**
   - Only include body in request when explicitly provided (not undefined)
   - Fixed testConnection() to not send any body for `/v1/get-feature-flags`
   - This matches how granola-automation-client handles requests

2. **Headers**
   - Kept all required headers (Authorization, X-App-Version, etc.)
   - Did not add Accept-Encoding (let Obsidian handle automatically)

### Phase 2: Updated API Endpoints & Response Handling

1. **Endpoint Changes**
   - Changed from `/v1/meetings` to `/v2/get-documents`
   - Using POST method with optional filters object

2. **Response Structure**
   - Changed from `response.data` to `response.docs`
   - Changed from `response.hasMore` to `response.next_cursor`
   - Implemented cursor-based pagination instead of page-based

3. **Request Format**
   - Pass filters as object: `{ limit: 100, cursor: "..." }`
   - Only include cursor in filters if we have one

### Phase 3: Fixed API Method Implementations

1. **getAllMeetings()**
   - Uses `/v2/get-documents` with proper filters
   - Handles cursor-based pagination
   - Added debug logging for response structure

2. **getMeetingsSince(since)**
   - Fetches all documents and filters client-side by date
   - Optimized to stop fetching when documents are older than target date
   - No server-side date filtering available in API

3. **getMeeting(id)**
   - No single document endpoint exists in Granola API
   - Currently returns null with warning log
   - Could be changed to fetch all and filter if needed

### Error Handling Improvements

- Simplified error response handling
- Removed gzip-specific error detection (not needed)
- Better error messages from API responses

## Testing Notes

The key fixes were:
1. Not sending empty body `{}` when no body is needed
2. Using correct endpoints and response structure
3. Proper cursor-based pagination

These changes align the plugin with how the working granola-automation-client operates.
