# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Panel Type Definitions ✅
- Added `DocumentPanel` interface in `src/types/index.ts`
- Added `DocumentPanelsResponse` type for API response
- Added `PanelSection` type for structured panel data
- Updated `Meeting` interface to include `panels?: DocumentPanel[]` and `panelSections?: Record<string, string>`

### 2. Extended EnhancedGranolaService ✅
- Added `getDocumentPanels(documentId: string): Promise<DocumentPanel[]>` method
- Implemented error handling for panel API calls (returns empty array on failure)
- Tested panel fetching with real API - confirmed working

### 3. Created Panel Processing Service ✅
- Created `src/services/panel-processor.ts`
- Implemented `extractStructuredContent(panel: DocumentPanel): Record<string, string>`
- Added HTML to markdown conversion with `convertHtmlToMarkdown`
- Implemented `processKnownTemplates` for Josh Template and other structured panels

### 4. Updated transformMeeting Method ✅
- Modified to accept panels parameter
- Made async to support dynamic imports
- Integrated PanelProcessor to extract structured content

### 5. Updated Sync Engine ✅
- Modified `processBatch` to fetch panels for each meeting
- Added try-catch for graceful panel fetch failures
- Logs panel fetch results for debugging

### 6. Enhanced MarkdownBuilder ✅
- Added `buildPanelSections(panels: DocumentPanel[]): string[]` method
- Formats each panel as a markdown section with `## Panel: [Title]`
- Extracts and formats structured content from panels
- Handles HTML to markdown conversion

### 7. Build Verification ✅
- Successfully builds with `npm run build`
- Panel processing code is included in the compiled bundle
- All panel-related classes and methods are present

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Panel Fetching**: The plugin now fetches panels from the Granola API for each document during sync
2. **HTML Processing**: Converts panel HTML content to clean markdown
3. **Structured Content**: Extracts sections from panels (Introduction, Agenda Items, Key Decisions, etc.)
4. **Template Recognition**: Identifies and processes known templates like Josh Template
5. **Graceful Degradation**: If panels fail to fetch, sync continues without them

## Testing Results

- API integration confirmed working with real Granola data
- Panel fetching successful for documents that have panels
- HTML to markdown conversion working correctly
- Build includes all panel functionality

## Known Limitations

1. E2E tests need Obsidian mocking to run properly
2. Some TypeScript compilation errors in test files (doesn't affect main build)
3. Panel content is fetched per-document (could be optimized with batch fetching if API supports it)

## Next Steps for Phase 2

1. Implement transcript processing with speaker identification
2. Add transcript deduplication logic
3. Format transcripts with grouped speakers
4. Update Meeting interface for enhanced transcript support

## Code Quality

- All new code follows existing patterns
- Error handling implemented throughout
- Logging added for debugging
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
